## üìö Readwise Plugin

### What is Readwise?
Readwise is a service that syncs your highlights from books, articles, and other reading sources into your vault. The plugin automatically imports your reading highlights as markdown notes.

### Setting Up Readwise
1. **Open Plugin Hub**: Click the plugins icon in the sidebar
2. **Install Readwise**: Find and install the Readwise plugin
3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Enter your Readwise API token (get it from [readwise.io/access_token](https://readwise.io/access_token))
   - Choose export folder (default: `{vault}/Readwise/`)
   - Configure sync preferences

### Using Readwise
- **Manual Sync**: Click "Sync Now" in the plugin settings
- **Automatic UUIDs**: All imported files automatically receive unique identifiers for tracking
- **Organized Structure**: Notes are organized by type (Books, Articles, Tweets, etc.)
- **Rich Metadata**: Each note includes author, title, and source information
- **Highlights with Links**: Each highlight links back to the original source

### Note Identity & UUIDs

#### What are UUIDs?
Vault uses UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) to track notes across renames and moves. Each note has a unique ID in its frontmatter that persists regardless of filename changes.

#### Adding UUIDs to Existing Notes
If you have notes without UUIDs (created before UUID support or imported from elsewhere):

1. **Open Developer Console**: Press `Cmd+Option+I`
2. **Run Command**: Type `addUUIDs()` and press Enter
3. **Automatic Processing**: Vault will:
   - Scan all markdown files in your vault
   - Add UUIDs to notes missing them
   - Skip notes that already have UUIDs
   - Show a summary of changes

**Example Frontmatter with UUID:**
```yaml
---
id: 01989ff3-cb20-77f1-be4d-0ab12bc9d0ac
created_at: "2025-08-12T20:23:31.360839+00:00"
updated_at: "2025-08-12T20:23:31.360839+00:00"
---
```

#### Benefits of UUIDs
- **Persistent Links**: Links between notes work even after renaming
- **History Tracking**: Track note evolution over time
- **Sync Safety**: Better synchronization across devices
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Enhanced compatibility with graph and linking plugins

## üì§ Export Your Work

### Export Formats
Vault can export your notes to multiple formats:

- **PDF**: High-quality PDF with images
